Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Giants
by Oven Love, only slightly adapted from Vintage Dutch Girl
makes 16-18 large cookies

1 cup canned pumpkin
1 cup white sugar
1/2 cup canola oil
1 egg
1 teaspoon milk
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips

Preheat oven to 350 degrees and line three baking sheets with parchment paper.

Whisk pumpkin, sugar, oil, egg, milk and vanilla in a large bowl.
In another bowl, stir the dry ingredients.
Add the dry ingredients to the pumpkin mixture and mix well.
Add chocolate chips and stir to combine.

Scoop batter with an ice cream scoop and drop onto the parchment paper,
leaving space between the cookies.
Bake for 5-6 minutes, rotate in the oven, then bake 5-6 minutes more
until puffed and lightly brown.  Let cool on wire racks before serving.
